# Rewards / Shops / Rest / Map Domain Audit

## Status
- Engine coverage exists, but action path normalization and parity hardening remain.

## Confirmed gaps
- [ ] Route reward emission/execution through a single canonical handler path.
- [ ] Ensure proceed gating semantics are exact and test-locked.
- [ ] Verify modifier relic interactions in reward/shop/rest/map phases.
- [ ] Ensure map/room transition invariants remain deterministic.

## Feature IDs
- `RWD-001`, `RWD-002`, `RWD-003`, `RWD-004`
- `RSM-*` follow-up as needed
