# Orbs / System Support Domain Audit

## Status
- Critical blocker domain for final powers/relic parity closure.
- Placeholder TODO paths remain in orb-linked relic hooks.

## Confirmed gaps
- [ ] Orb slot/channel/evoke/passive timing infrastructure parity.
- [ ] Focus and Lock-On interactions where applicable.
- [ ] Remove parity-critical placeholder behavior from relic/power hooks.

## Feature IDs
- `ORB-001` foundational orb parity implementation
- `POW-003` integration coverage consuming orb system behavior
