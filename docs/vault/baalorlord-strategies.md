## Deck Archetypes

### 1. Stance Dance (Strongest)
**Optimal Ratio**: Calm : Exit : Wrath = 3 : 3 : 2

**Core Cards**:
- Tantrum (multi-hit Wrath entry)
- Inner Peace (Calm entry + draw)
- Rushdown (draw 2 on Wrath entry)
- Mental Fortress (4-6 block per stance change)
- Flurry of Blows (free, returns on stance change)
- Empty Body/Fist (safe Wrath exit)

**Strategy**:
1. Enter Calm for energy generation
2. Switch to Wrath for damage bursts
3. Exit Wrath before enemy attacks
4. Generate block through Mental Fortress cycling

### 2. Divinity/Mantra
**Core Cards**:
- Devotion (+2-3 Mantra per turn)
- Worship (+5 Mantra)
- Prostrate (+2-3 Mantra + block)
- Pray (+3-4 Mantra + Insight)
- Brilliance (scales with total Mantra)

**Relics**:
- Damaru (+1 Mantra per turn)

**Strategy**:
- Optimal entry: Exit Calm (+2 energy) -> Enter Divinity (+3 energy) = 5 energy burst
- Three Devotions enable Divinity every turn

### 3. Scry Control
**Core Cards**:
- Foresight (Scry 3-4 at turn start)
- Third Eye (block + Scry 3-5)

- Just Lucky (free Scry)
- Weave (returns from discard on Scry)

**Relics**:
- Golden Eye (+2 cards per Scry)
- Melange (Scry 3 on shuffle)

**Synergy**: Nirvana grants block whenever you Scry

### 4. Retain/Battle Hymn
**Core Cards**:
- Battle Hymn (add Smite at turn start)
- Establishment (Retained cards cost -1)
- Windmill Strike (+4-5 damage per turn retained)
- Sands of Time (cost decreases on retain)
- Protect (12-16 block, Retain)

**Strategy**:
- Stack Retained cards for explosive finishing turns
- Establishment makes Smites free after first turn

### 5. Talk to the Hand
**Core Cards**:
- Talk to the Hand (permanent block per Attack)
- Multi-hit attacks (Flying Sleeves, Ragnarok)
- Wave of the Hand (Weak on block gain)

**Setup**:
1. Clear Artifact with Wave of the Hand
2. Apply Block Closed
3. Multi-hit to maximize block generation

## Relic Priorities

### S-Tier
| Relic | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Singing Bowl** | +2 Max HP on skip (prevents deck bloat) |
| **Dead Branch** | Random card on exhaust |
| **Holy Water** | +3 Miracles at combat start |
| **Violet Lotus** | +1 Energy on Calm exit (total 3) |
| **Pen Nib** | Double every 10th Attack |

### A-Tier
| Relic | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Unceasing Top** | Draw when hand empty |
| **Teardrop Locket** | Start combat in Calm |
| **Golden Eye** | +2 cards per Scry |
| **Damaru** | +1 Mantra per turn |

## Decision Frameworks

### Universal Principles
1. **Deck Size**: 10-20 cards optimal
2. **Card Removal**: Strikes first, then Defends
3. **HP is Currency**: Minimize total damage over fights
4. **Contextual Picks**: No universally correct choices

### Act 1 Priority
- Early question marks (gold, relic, removal)
- Accept HP loss for card removal (pay 7 HP)
- Essential picks: Deva Form, Simmering Fury, Crescendo
- First upgrade: Deva Form (remove Ethereal)

### Upgrade Heuristics
- Compare absolute damage points, not percentages
- Energy reductions on repeatable cards > one-time exhausts
- Multi-target bonuses > single-target

### Stance Management
- **Calm**: Default economical stance
- **Wrath**: Only when protected or for burst
- **Divinity**: Optimal from Calm (5 total energy)
- **Never end turn in Wrath without protection**

## Boss Fight Strategy

### Heart Fight Requirements
1. Generate 30+ Block within 3 turns
2. Prepare burst damage early
3. Accept turn 2 damage for scaling
4. Scaling: Stack bonuses -> multiply -> burst

### Scaling Formula
1. Apply additive modifiers (Strength)
2. Apply multiplicative modifiers (Wrath, Divinity)
3. Execute finishing turn
