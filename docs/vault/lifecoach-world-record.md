# Lifecoach World Record Watcher Streak

## Record Details

**Player**: Lifecoach (former Hearthstone pro, "Ropecoach")
**Record**: 52 consecutive wins on Ascension 20 Heart
**Win Rate**: 94% over last 50 games at A20
**Character**: Watcher

### Milestones
- 42 wins before expanding to 50 target
- 52 wins achieved
- 69-0 attempt ended October (unsuccessful)

## Winning Strategy: Stance Dance Infinite

### Core Combo Requirements
1. **Rushdown** (Power): "Whenever you enter Wrath, draw 2 cards"
2. **Eruption+** (Attack): Low-cost Wrath entry (MUST be upgraded)
3. **Inner Peace** or **Fear No Evil**: Reliable Calm access
4. **Scrawl** (Skill): Card draw until hand full

### Supporting Cards
- Mental Fortress: 4-6 block on stance change
- Tantrum: Stance cycling flexibility
- Cut Through Fate: Draw + damage + scry

### Key Relics
- **Violet Lotus**: Extra energy on Calm exit (critical)
- **Peace Pipe**: Deck thinning at shops
- **Runic Pyramid**: Hand retention for combo

### Infinite Loop Mechanics
```
Enter Calm -> Generate 2-3 energy ->
Enter Wrath -> Rushdown draws 2 ->
Energy from Calm enables replay ->
Repeat infinitely
```

## Decision Framework

### Card Selection Priorities

**S+ Tier (Always Pick)**:
- Scrawl
- Vault
- Talk to the Hand
- Blasphemy (high-risk burst)

**S Tier (Strong Picks)**:
- Meditate
- Tantrum
- Cut Through Fate
- Inner Peace
- Fear No Evil

### Critical Principles
1. **Deck Size**: Target 5-6 cards for infinite combo
2. **Card Removal**: Peace Pipe > keeping card slots
3. **Starter Removal**: Strike/Defend drag down infinite potential
4. **Context**: Card value depends on existing deck

## Fight Decision Patterns

### Heart Boss Strategy
1. **Block Requirement**: 30+ block within 3 turns
2. **Damage Pressure**: Burst early - Heart gains Strength
3. **Stance Ratio**: Calm:Exit:Wrath = 3:3:2
4. **Time Investment**: Heart fights can exceed 2 hours

### Per-Turn Decisions
- 15+ minutes per card selection in critical moments
- Mathematical precision required
- Calculate exact damage accounting for relics, cards, deck state
